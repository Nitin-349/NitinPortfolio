            Hello! I’m Nitin Upmanyu, an enthusiastic and driven Associate Software Engineer with a deep passion for coding, continuous growth, and problem-solving. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, I specialize in building dynamic and intuitive user interfaces, as well as robust backend solutions.
    
            Currently, I’m working at TechInfini Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as a Shopify Developer, where I’m involved in building custom apps and extensions to enhance the eCommerce experience for clients. Additionally, I work as an Odoo Developer, developing and integrating business management solutions tailored to streamline operations across various industries. This role has allowed me to sharpen my skills in delivering both custom solutions and scalable applications.
    
            Prior to this, I gained valuable hands-on experience during my internship at Puru Technologies, where I contributed to the development of college software, focusing on frontend enhancement. My work included:
    
            Collaborating on the redesign of key features to improve user experience.
            Implementing Angular for optimized routing and data handling.
            Crafting dynamic and responsive web pages using Grid and Flexbox layouts.
            In addition to my professional experience, I’m also a strong believer in community involvement. As a National Service Scheme (NSS) Volunteer, I’ve actively contributed to educating local communities and organizing events that foster social development. This engagement has enriched my leadership and communication skills, enabling me to be an effective team player.
            I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from Gyan Sagar College of Engineering, where I graduated with a 9.06 CGPA, and was recognized as an academic topper. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on several projects, including a Cafe Management System and a College Software platform, both of which demonstrated my ability to integrate diverse technologies to create seamless user experiences.
    
            Driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my skills and take on new challenges.
